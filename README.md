## Summary
**TTM** is C++ high-performance tensor-matrix multiplication **header-only library**
It provides free C++ functions for parallel computing the **mode-`q` tensor-times-matrix product** of the general form

$$
\Large
\underline{\mathbf{C}} = \underline{\mathbf{A}} \bullet_q \mathbf{B} \quad :\Leftrightarrow \quad
\underline{\mathbf{C}} (i_1, \dots, i_{q-1}, j, i_{q+1}, \dots, i_p) = \sum_{i_q=1}^{n_q} \underline{\mathbf{A}}({i_1, \dots, i_q,  \dots, i_p}) \cdot \mathbf{B}({j,i_q}).
$$

where $q$ is the contraction mode, $\underline{\mathbf{A}}$ and $\underline{\mathbf{C}}$ are tensors of order $p$ with shapes $\mathbf{n}\_a= (n\_1,\dots n\_{q-1},n\_q ,n\_{q+1},\dots,n\_p)$ and $\mathbf{n}\_c = (n\_1,\dots,n\_{q-1},m,n\_{q+1},\dots,n\_p)$, respectively.
The order-$2$ tensor $\mathbf{B}$ is a matrix with shape $\mathbf{n}\_b = (m,n\_{q})$.

A simple example of the tensor-matrix multiplication is the matrix-matrix multiplication with $\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{B} \cdot \mathbf{A}$ with $q=1$.
The number of dimensions (order) $p$ and the dimensions $n_r$ as well as the linear tensor layout $\mathbf{\pi}$ of the tensors $\underline{\mathbf{A}}$ and $\underline{\mathbf{C}}$ can be chosen at runtime.

All function implementations are based on the Loops-Over-GEMM (LOG) approach and utilize high-performance `GEMM` or `GEMV` routines of `BLAS` such as OpenBLAS or Intel MKL without transposing the tensor.
The library is an extension of the [boost/ublas](https://github.com/boostorg/ublas) tensor library containing the sequential version. Implementation details and runtime behevior of the tensor-matrix multiplication functions are described in ???.

Please have a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/bassoy/ttv/wiki) page for more informations about the **usage**, **function interfaces** and the **setting parameters**.

## Key Features

### Flexibility
* Contraction mode `q`, tensor order `p`, tensor extents `n` and tensor layout `pi` can be chosen at runtime
* Supports any linear tensor layout inlcuding the first-order and last-order storage layouts
* Offers two high-level and one C-like low-level interfaces for calling the tensor-times-matrix multiplication
* Implemented independent of a tensor data structure (can be used with `std::vector` and `std::array`)
* Supports float, double, complex and double complex data types (and more if a BLAS library is not used)

### Performance
* Multi-threading support with OpenMP
* Can be used with and without a BLAS implementation
* Performs in-place operations without transposing the tensor - no extra memory needed
* For large tensors reaches peak matrix-times-matrix performance

### Requirements
* Requires the tensor elements to be contiguously stored in memory.
* Element types must be an arithmetic type suporting multiplication and addition operator

## Experiments

The experiments were carried out on a Core i9-7900X Intel Xeon processor with 10 cores and 20 hardware threads running at 3.3 GHz.
The source code has been compiled with GCC v7.3 using the highest optimization level `-Ofast` and `-march=native`, `-pthread` and `-fopenmp`. 
Parallel execution has been accomplished using GCC â€™s implementation of the OpenMP v4.5 specification. 
We have used the `dot` and `gemv` implementation of the OpenBLAS library v0.2.20. 
The benchmark results of each of the following functions are the average of 10 runs.

The comparison includes three state-of-the-art libraries that implement three different approaches. 
* [TCL](https://github.com/springer13/tcl) (v0.1.1 ) implements the TTGT approach. 
* [TBLIS](https://github.com/devinamatthews/tblis) ( v1.0.0 ) implements the GETT approach.
* [EIGEN](https://bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/src/default/) ( v3.3.90 ) sequentially executes the tensor-times-vector in-place.

The experiments were carried out with asymmetrically-shaped and symmetrically-shaped tensors in order to provide a comprehensive test coverage where
the tensor elements are stored according to the first-order storage format.
The tensor order of the asymmetrically- and symmetrically-shaped tensors have been varied from `2` to `10` and `2` to `7`, respectively.
The contraction mode `q` has also been varied from `1` to the tensor order.

### Symmetrically-Shaped Tensors

**TTM** has been executed with parameters `tlib::execution::blas`, `tlib::slicing::large` and `tlib::loop_fusion::all`

## Example 
```cpp
/*main.cpp*/
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <iostream>
#include <tlib/ttv.h>


int main()
{
  const auto q = 2ul; // contraction mode
  
  auto A = tlib::tensor<float>( {4,3,2} ); 
  auto B = tlib::tensor<float>( {3,1}   );
  std::iota(A.begin(),A.end(),1);
  std::fill(B.begin(),B.end(),1);

/*
  A =  { 1  5  9  | 13 17 21
         2  6 10  | 14 18 22
         3  7 11  | 15 19 23
         4  8 12  | 16 20 24 };

  B =   { 1 1 1 } ;
*/

  // computes mode-2 tensor-times-vector product with C(i,j) = A(i,k,j) * B(k)
  auto C1 = A (q)* B; 
  
/*
  C =  { 1+5+ 9 | 13+17+21
         2+6+10 | 14+18+22
         3+7+11 | 15+19+23
         4+8+12 | 16+20+24 };
*/
}
```
Compile with `g++ -I../include/ -std=c++17 -Ofast -fopenmp main.cpp -o main` and additionally `-DUSE_OPENBLAS` or `-DUSE_INTELBLAS`  for fast execution.
